<h2>Destructive Actions - Delete @ItemTitle</h2>

<div class="ils-input-disclaimer">
    <label for="deletebox">
        Deleting this will delete all items associated with this (so deleting a program will delete all credentials, deleting a course will delete all sections, etc.). Deleting is done automatically and there is no <em>undo</em> button for this. We strongly recommend backing up your data before deleting so you can re-import the data if it becomes needed. Having read this, are you sure you want to delete this?
